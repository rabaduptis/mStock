# mStock - Inventory Tracking Application

Inventory tracking application by scanning barcode. It is an application where some structures such as barcode reading (**ML-Kit**), Android **Room** database reading and writing operations, dependency injection (**Hilt**), **AndroidX LiveData**, **AndroidX Navigation Component**, **MVVM** are demonstrated.

It is an application developed as an **ML-Kit barcode reading demo, not as a fully functional application**, so no UI development has been done.
